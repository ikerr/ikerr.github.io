If we wanted to power all automobiles with electricity, how much more electricity would we need?

Let's do some "back of the napkin" math...

First, let's make a couple simplifying assumptions. Let's focus on the States, and let's assume that everyone drives a Tesla Model S, with an 85 kWh battery pack and a range of 265 miles.

According to the US Department of Energy, the Annual Vehicle Miles Traveled in the U.S. in 2015 was about three trillion. How many charges are needed to travel that distance?

3,000,000,000,000 / 265 equals about 11,320,754,717

How much electricity does that many charges require?

11,320,754,717 x 85 kWh = 962,264,150,945 kWh

In Gigawatt hours, that's about 962,264 GWh.

To put that in perspective, the States produced 4.093 million GWh of electricity in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

So, moving fully to electric vehicles would require about 24% of the electricity currently being produced.
